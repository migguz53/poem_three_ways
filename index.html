        <div class="poem">
            <p class="leftside"> Under the separated leaves of shade<br/>
                Of the gingko, that old tree<br/>
                That has existed essentially unchanged<br/>
                Longer than any other living tree, <br/>
                I walk behind a woman. Her hair's coarse gold<br/>
                Is spun from the sunlight that it rides upon.<br/>
                Women were paid to knit from sweet champagne<br/>
                Her second skin: it winds and unwinds, winds<br/>
                Up her long legs, delectable haunches,<br/>
                As she sways, in sunlight, up the gazing aisle.<br/>
                The shade of the tree that is called maidenhair,<br/>
                That is not positively known<br/>
                To exist in a wild state, spots her fair or almost fair<br/>
                Hair twisted in a French twist; tall or almost tall,<br/>
                She walks through the air the rain has washed, a clear thing<br/>
                Moving easily on its high heels, seeming to men<br/>
                Miraculous . . . Since I can call her, as Swann couldn't,<br/>
                A woman who is my type, I follow with the warmth<br/>
                Of familiarity, of novelty, this new<br/>
                Example of the type,<br/>
                Reminded of how Lorenz's just-hatched goslings<br/>
                Shook off the last remnants of the egg<br/>
                And, looking at Lorenz, realized that Lorenz<br/>
                Was their mother. Quacking, his little family<br/>
                Followed him everywhere; and when they met a goose, <br/>
                Their mother, they ran to him afraid.
            </p>
            
            <p class="rightside"> Imprinted upon me<br/>
                Is the shape I run to, the sweet strange<br/>
                Breath-taking contours that breathe to me: "I am yours,<br/>
                Be mine!"
            </p>

            <p class="leftside"> Following this new<br/>
                Body, somehow familiar, this young shape, somehow old,<br/>
                For a moment I'm younger, the century is younger.<br/>
                The living Strauss, his moustache just getting gray,<br/>
                Is shouting to the players: "Louder!<br/>
                Louder! I can still hear Madame Schumann-Heink—"<br/>
                Or else, white, bald, the old man's joyfully<br/>
                Telling conductors they must play Elektra<br/>
                Like A Midsummer Night's Dream—like fairy music;<br/>
                Proust, dying, is swallowing his iced beer<br/>
                And changing in proof the death of Bergotte<br/>
                According to his own experience; Garbo, <br/>
                A commissar in Paris, is listening attentively<br/>
                To the voice telling how McGillicuddy met McGillivray, <br/>
                And McGillivray said to McGillicuddy—no, McGillicuddy<br/>
                Said to McGillivray—that is, McGillivray . . . Garbo<br/>
                Says seriously: "I vish dey'd never met."
            </p>

            <p class="leftside"> As I walk behind this woman I remember<br/>
                That before I flew here—waked in the forest<br/>
                At dawn, by the piece called Birds Beginning Day<br/>
                That, each day, birds play to begin the day—<br/>
                I wished as men wish: "May this day be different!"<br/>
                The birds were wishing, as birds wish—over and over, <br/>
                With a last firmness, intensity, reality—<br/>
                "May this day be the same!"
            </p>

            <p class="rightside"> Ah, turn to me<br/>
                And look into my eyes, say: "I am yours, <br/>
                Be mine!"
            </p>

            <p class="leftside"> My wish will have come true. And yet<br/>
                When your eyes meet my eyes, they'll bring into <br/>
                The weightlessness of my pure wish the weight<br/>
                Of a human being: someone to help or hurt,<br/>
                Someone to be good to me, to be good to, <br/>
                Someone to cry when I am angry<br/>
                That she doesn't like Elektra, someone to start out on Proust with.<br/>
                A wish, come true, is life. I have my life.<br/>
                When you turn just slide your eyes across my eyes<br/>
                And show in a look flickering across your face<br/>
                As lightly as a leaf's shade, a bird's wing, <br/>
                That there is no one in the world quite like me, <br/>
                That if only . . . If only . . . 
            </p>

            <p class="rightside"> That will be enough. </p>
            
            <p class="leftside"> But I've pretended long enough: I walk faster<br/>
                And come close, touch with the tip of my finger<br/>
                The nape of her neck, just where the gold<br/>
                Hair stops, and the champagne-colored dress begins. <br/>
                My finger touches her as the gingko's shadow<br/>
                Touches her. 
            </p>

            <p class="leftside"> Because, after all, it is my wife<br/>
                In a new dress from Bergdorf's, walking toward the park.<br/>
                She cries out, we kiss each other, and walk arm in arm<br/>
                Through the sunlight that's much too good for New York, <br/>
                The sunlight of our own house in the forest.<br/>
                Still, though, the poor things need it . . . We've no need<br/>
                To start out on Proust, to ask each other about Strauss. <br/>
                We first helped each other, hurt each other, years ago.<br/>
                After so many changes made and joys repeated, <br/>
                Our first bewildered, transcending recognition <br/>
                Is pure acceptance. We can't tell our life<br/>
                From our wish. Really I began the day<br/>
                Not with a man's wish: "May this day be different,"<br/>
                But with the birds' wish: "May this day<br/>
                Be the same day, the day of my life."
